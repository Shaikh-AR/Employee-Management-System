            <h1>Employee-Management-System</h1>
            <p>In the Employee Management System project, I proficiently executed comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the dynamic duo of Servlets and JSP. This dynamic combination allowed for seamless interaction between the user interface and server-side logic, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for managing employee data. From adding and viewing records to updating information and handling deletions, the Servlets and JSP architecture played a pivotal role in creating a robust and user-friendly system. This approach not only simplified the development process but also enhanced the overall functionality of the Employee Management System.
